To bootstrap the build system:

	./autogen.sh

This will generate the configure string and various autotools dependencies.
Then, to compile a linux binary ("butterflyprog"):

	./configure && make
	
If you want to output the compiler warnings :

	./configure CXXFLAGS=-Wall && make

Or to generate a windows binary ("butterflyprog.exe"):

	./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc --build=i686-linux && make
        
If you want to output the compiler warnings :

        ./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc --build=i686-linux CXXFLAGS="-Wall -DWINDOWS" && make

That is assuming you have MinGW installed. On Debian and Ubuntu systems,
"apt-get mingw32" should be all that's needed.

The windows binary will still need the FTDI driver DLL installed on the
system to work.


FIXME: you will probably have to manually switch on the WINDOWS macros. 
        ./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc --build=i686-linux CXXFLAGS="-DWINDOWS -Wall" && make
